# dash-mobile
This is the mobile application of my personal project called Dash. 

- The goals is to allow users to join chatrooms via mobile device. The user's desired chatroom id is unique and can only be accessed if the user already knows the id before hand. When a user leaves a chatroom, all the messages are deleted. I believe this is a new way / interesting mode of communication. 

- Possible usages: 
    - ice breakers
    - Communicating with clients without exchanging social media or other personal contact information
    - Finding new friends / networking by posting chatroom id's publically
